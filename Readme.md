# PIC Assembler Example for PIC18F57Q43
Tested with PIC18F57Q43 CURIOSITY NANO EVALUATION KIT

## Requirements
- MPLAB X IDE v6.10
- MPLAB XC8 Compiler v2.41 (Free)
- pic-as is included in XC8 package

## Description
PIC Assembler only projects require custom linker options for reset vector and interrupt vector.
These are already configured in the project file.
The example shows the use of the uart- and the timer-interrupt.
